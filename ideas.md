# Ideas

* If we can self sabotage our good ideas, can then we do the same to the bad ideas that are constantly playing on repeat in our heads ? We are no strangers to our best intentions and ideas being thwarted by the negative under current of self doubt and negative self talk. What if we turn the tables using the same strategies on our fears and our dooms day thoughts by subjecting them to deluge of positive questions and internal thoughts ? The crucial point here is that we must be able to spot when a bad thought or ideas pops up and go into observer mode.
