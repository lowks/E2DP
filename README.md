# Background

Experiences of getting DevOps institutionalised in the corporate environment.

When something is as important as DevOps and organisational agility, the goal gets elevated to a mission or in the words of Simon Sinek a just cause. 

A _**Just cause**_ has got to go beyond your line manager, your immediate bosses whim and fancies or current interest or obsessions. It's bigger than your current company and bigger than the current scope of what you are able to do. 

Agile coaching makes the changes brought by mindset changes and technical new practices enduring. Coaching is about listening not about talking. The key to coaching the team is to remember, you are their coach you are not one of the team. Don't make your vote count, help them come to a decision. Don't be part of the problem and don't be part of the solution. The team knows how to solve their own problems.
