# Why E2DP

Too long we tried to change the process, the process became the center of attention and ire. There was not a chance to try out a new process with much hub bub. A way had to be found to prototype our changes. Enter E2DP. E2DP is the acronym for "Engineering Driven Delivery Pipeline".

There are companies who have gone the tools part, there are some on the human path. DevOps talks about both of them together for a reason. Human engineering makes the changes enduring.

What is important is not positivity on the situation or a steel will or even power \(What I too initially thought would be the key\) but rather a persistence of vision or holding steadfast to a vision of what you want to do. Small pivots do happen as you learn more. The E2DP that exist today is so much different from the initial vision of what it was going to be or how it would function. Do-learn-change-adapt-do is such a powerful concept that is at the heart of every transformation.

Transparency and a commitment to the change are the prerequisites to the change.
