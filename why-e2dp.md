# Why E2DP

Too long we tried to change the process, the process became the center of attention and ire. There was not a chance to try out a new process with much hub bub. A way had to be found to prototype our changes. Enter E2DP. E2DP is the acronym for "Engineering Driven Delivery Pipeline".

There are companies who have gone the tools part, there are some on the human path. DevOps talks about both of them together for a reason. Human engineering makes the changes enduring.
