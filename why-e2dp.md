# Why E2DP

Too long we tried to change the process, the process became the center of attention and ire. There was not a chance to try out a new process with much hub bub. A way had to be found to prototype our changes. Enter E2DP. E2DP is the acronym for "Engineering Driven Delivery Pipeline".

There are companies who have gone the tools part, there are some on the human path. DevOps talks about both of them together for a reason. Human engineering makes the changes enduring.

What is important is not positivity on the situation or a steel will or even power \(What I too initially thought would be the key\) but rather a persistence of vision or holding steadfast to a vision of what you want to do. Small pivots do happen as you learn more. The E2DP that exist today is so much different from the initial vision of what it was going to be or how it would function. Do-learn-change-adapt-do is such a powerful concept that is at the heart of every transformation.

Transparency and a commitment to the change are the prerequisites to the change.

One thing that I learned while trying to create a DevOps culture was that process changes needed to be prototyped and tested too for the two following reasons: 

* People listen very little during presentations.
* They take away even less than that.

That's why too a prototype to see the process in action actualizing the new process into the world so that people who are going to be using it is essential and a very important part of instituituonalizng a process change in a corporate company. The more people involved in the process change, the elaborate the prototype.

**Benefits of DevOps ?**

The benefits of Devops or anything form of automation that really matters are those benefits discerned via goals that are aligned with the business. Ask yourself this question: _Would you go and ask your mechanic what is the benefits of repairing your car in time ?_
