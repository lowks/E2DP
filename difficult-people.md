# Difficult people

* Everybody has their journey, don't cut short their journey _if you can_
* Enneagram and typing helps a lot.
* You don't need a better team, your team deserves a better you. Work on yourself more before looking for aspects of your teams to improve. It's a journey you attempt together.
